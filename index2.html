                She is an old soul in a fast, new world.
                
                Northern Californian vocalist/producer/instrumentalist virgogabrielle takes listeners to the dreamland through her candid lyrics, R&B inspired guitar, and layered melodies. Her compositions are designed to make people feel something wavy, something real, something genuine.  <br>
                
                Listeners have described Virgo’s music on a spectrum of soothing and dreamy to powerful and hard-hitting, bringing about a true duality. Veering between jazzy, even slightly ed    gy neo-soul and hip-hop, Virgo’s signature style is a fusion of many influences. Inspiration from Jessie Reyez, K.Flay, Dreezy and Nai Palm can be heard, just to name a few. <br>

            <h2 data-scroll="" data-scroll-speed="1" class="content__text blur-effect frosted-glass">
                     Virgo’s music revolves around embracing the authentic self and being upfront about the good, the bad and everything in between. Through this unfiltered honesty, Virgo brings listeners to a place not easily found in a world full of hiding. <br>
                
                Virgo performs both solo and with her full band, particularly enjoying events that foster community through sharing music. Her EP release show held at Renaissance Square in June 2021 drew over 100 people, as herself and the band performed the entirety of her “999” project. Virgo has played around the United States with organizations such as Sofar Sounds, also taking her music to New York for the first time to perform at SOB’s via Major Stage in July 2022.  <br>
                
                Besides composing her solo music, Virgo does work scoring films as well as offering songwriting consultation. In May 2022, she sang the National Anthem for Sacramento during a River Cats baseball game at Sutter Health Park. <br></h2> </section>
