                <p>Listeners have described Virgo’s music on a spectrum of soothing and dreamy to powerful and hard-hitting, bringing about a true duality. Veering between jazzy, even slightly edgy neo-soul and hip-hop, Virgo’s signature style is a fusion
                    of many influences. Just to name a few, inspiration from Jessie Reyez, K.Flay, Dreezy and Nai Palm can be heard</span>
